# H2AuxInvest
An Open-Source Project to Develop Hydrogen Supply Chains

We are here to help solve the problem of poor knowledge transfer in Scotland's Hydrogen Supply Chain

**The Problem:**
Developers do not have enough available information to risk purchasing low TRL components from small manufacturers.  
This results in technology selection of more mature technologies from established international vendors with corresponding losses in performance across key metrics.

**The Problem Broken Down:**
•	Unavailable, unverifiable manufacturer data for auxiliaries

•	Multiple unknowns between real world performance and available public domain information

•	Procurement of real data can only happen at a late stage in the procurement process when there is a high-level of sunk cost

•	Only modelling tools available are generic, obsolete, sales tools or not relevant to the Scottish market

•	Uncertainties mean that investment in auxiliaries carries a significant risk premium, with the use of low TRL equipment from any non-major manufacturers not currently viable

**How to Solve it:**
•	Creation of an open-source and modifiable software tool that uses real-world low TRL datasets in comparison with supplier agnostic open-source high TRL data 
and site location to generate key capital metrics, enabling investment in equipment with realisable improvements in cost, safety, operability, risk, environmental and social outcomes.

•	The tool would be designed to allow the facile inclusion of user data sources while still providing reliable information.

**Our Vision – H2 AuxInvest:**
•	H2 AuxInvest would consist of a webtool linking to backend capable of providing: 

(i) Shortcut optimisation and sizing of storage and compression based on user inputs, 
(ii) Key financial outputs such as CAPEX and OPEX for systems - comparing proposed low TRL solutions against mature systems currently in commercial operation, 
(iii) Easy to understand report delineating key metrics, limitations of chosen design orientation and next steps.

•	Use an open-source approach meeting accessibility standards with the creation of forums and community contributions. 
This would become self-sustaining and create a rich environment for knowledge transfer,

•	Complete the “missing part of the puzzle” as Scottish component manufacturers will only be successful if the proposed green hydrogen project pipeline increases 
and projects can succeed at a variety of scales using innovative technology.  This project has the goal of increasing access to finance and reducing cost of finance 
through improving investor confidence and reducing barriers created through the requirements for a high-level of capital spend during initial development.
